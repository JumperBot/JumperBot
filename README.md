- 👋 Hi, I’m @JumperBot
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, and making animated videos.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JScript, CSS, and HTML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making my website (currently under construction).
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, that's not so much of a good idea to be honest.
